        <h1>Career/Experience</h1>
        <h2>Dajaco</h2>
        <p>When I was 16, I spent the summer working at a factory that supplies
        small car parts to the Big 3 companies. Here, I spent 50-60 hours a week
        working on a machine and sorting/checking parts. It was a very good start for me in
        terms of a work career. It showed me that value of a dollar and what hard work is.</p>
        <h2>Little Caesars</h2>
        <p>I spent the next 4 years working here. I did everything from prepping the dough for pizzas,
        to making them, and then selling them. This job showed me what true customer service is, as well
        as the importance of a good workplace environment. The better the environment, the happier you are and
        the less it feels like a 'job'.</p>
        <h2>General Motors</h2>
        <p>This is where my career in computer science and programming will start in June 2016. I look
        forward to using my skills I learned over the past 4 years and applying them into the workforce. </p>
