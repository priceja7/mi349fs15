        <h1>Music</h1>
        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>One day when it was rainy and I was bored back in high school,
        I went downstairs and found an old keyboard laying around. I plugged it in
        and began hitting random keys on it, thinking to myself that I should sit
        down and learn this instrument. So I began to search on the web 'how to play piano'.
        After some searching, I found a YouTube video for a song that I really liked. The video
        was a tutorial of how to play the song. It took me a few weeks to learn it, but once I did,
        I fell in love with playing. I began to search how to play more songs and learn them
        as well.</p>

        <p>I've been doing this for probably about 4-5 years now, and I have no plans
        on stoping. I have taught myself music theory, scales, and I can now play music
        by ear (playing a song out of memory, just by hearing it).</p>
        <h2>Future</h2>
        <p>My future plans regarding music, include setting up a recording studio and begin to write
        original music. I would also like to expand my musical horizons to other instruments as well
        as vocals. After college, I plan to take vocal lessons in order to progress as a musical artist.</p>
